For Iteration 1 (aligned with Milestone 1 in your README), your focus should be on laying a solid foundation with the UCI Poker Hand Dataset. Since this is your starting point for learning Python and building the poker ML project, the objective should be achievable, educational, and set you up for future iterations. Here’s a detailed plan for Iteration 1:

Iteration 1: Data Loading and Basic Exploration
Objective
Load the UCI Poker Hand Dataset, parse it into a usable format, and print basic statistics to understand its structure and contents.

Why This Objective?
Learning Python: You’ll practice file I/O, pandas, and basic data manipulation—core skills for any Python project.
Project Foundation: Understanding the dataset is critical before building evaluators or ML models.
Quick Win: It’s manageable and gives you a tangible result (stats) to build confidence.
Tasks
Set Up Environment:
Ensure your folder structure is in place (from earlier).
Install dependencies via requirements.txt.
Download the Dataset:
Get the UCI Poker Hand Dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/158/poker+hand.
Place poker-hand-training-true.data and poker-hand-testing.data in data/raw/.
Load the Data:
Write code in src/data_processing.py to read the .data files into a pandas DataFrame.
The UCI files are comma-separated with no headers; columns are:
S1, R1, S2, R2, S3, R3, S4, R4, S5, R5, Class
(Suit 1-4, Rank 1-13 for 5 cards, Class 0-9 for hand type).
Parse and Clean:
Add column names to the DataFrame for clarity.
Check for missing values or anomalies (UCI data is clean, but good practice).
Print Basic Stats:
Number of hands (total rows).
Distribution of hand types (e.g., how many "Pair" vs. "Flush").
Sample a few rows to see the data in action.
Save Processed Data:
Export the DataFrame to data/processed/hands_processed.csv for future use.
Deliverables
A working src/data_processing.py script that:
Loads the UCI training dataset.
Outputs stats to the console (e.g., "Total hands: 25,010", "Hand type counts: ...").
A hands_processed.csv file in data/processed/.
Optionally, a notebooks/explore_data.ipynb with your initial exploration.

What's expected:

Total hands: 25010
Hand type distribution:
Nothing           12493
One Pair          10599
Two Pair           1206
Three of a Kind     513
Straight            388
Flush               198
Full House          108
Four of a Kind       26
Straight Flush       12
Royal Flush           3
Name: Class, dtype: int64

Sample hands:
   S1  R1  S2  R2  S3  R3  S4  R4  S5  R5  Class
0   1  10   1  11   1  12   1  13   1   1      9
1   2   4   2   5   2   3   2   2   2   6      5
...
